# Application Architecture with React, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query

## Introduction

This document aims to provide an in-depth overview of the architecture and components of our application, which utilizes **React** for the UI, **Redux Toolkit** for state management, and **Redux Toolkit Query** for data fetching. This setup allows for efficient state management, code scalability, and clear separation of concerns.

### Overview of Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, focusing on creating reusable UI components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: The official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It includes utilities for setting up a Redux store and creating reducers and actions with less boilerplate.
- **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)**: A powerful data-fetching and caching tool built on top of Redux Toolkit. It simplifies data fetching and integrates seamlessly with Redux state management.

## Key Concepts

### Redux Toolkit

#### Slices

A **Slice** in Redux Toolkit is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a specific feature or section of your application. Slices help in organizing code and are created using the `createSlice` method, which automatically generates action creators and action types based on the reducers provided.

**Example of a Slice:**

```typescript
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

export interface UserState {
  email: string | null;
  username: null;
}

const initialState: UserState = {
  email: null,
  username: null,
};

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setUser(state, action: PayloadAction<{ email: string, username: string}>) {
      const { email, username } = action.payload;
      console.log("setAuth payload");
      console.log(action);
    },
    clearUser(state) {
      state.email = null;
    },
  },
});

export const { setUser, clearUser } = userSlice.actions;
export default userSlice.reducer;
```

In this example, the `userSlice` manages user-related data, providing actions and reducers to update and clear user information.

#### Root Reducer

The **Root Reducer** is a combination of all individual reducers in your application. It provides a single source of truth for the entire application state, allowing different parts of the state to be managed independently and efficiently.

**Example of a Root Reducer:**

```typescript
import { combineReducers } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import authReducer from "./slices/authSlice";
import userReducer from "./slices/userSlice";
import packagesReducer from "./slices/packageSlice";
import uiReducer from "./slices/uiSlice";

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  auth: authReducer,
  user: userReducer,
  packages: packagesReducer,
  ui: uiReducer,
});

export default rootReducer;
```

#### Store Configuration

The **Redux Store** holds the complete state tree of your application. With Redux Toolkit, the store configuration is simplified with the `configureStore` method, which enhances the store with middleware, devtools, and more by default.

**Store Configuration Example:**

```typescript
import rootReducer from "./reducer";
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { setupListeners } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query";
import { apiBaseService } from "./services/apiBaseService";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    global: rootReducer,
    [apiBaseService.reducerPath]: apiBaseService.reducer,
  },
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware({
      serializableCheck: false,
      immutableCheck: false,
    }).concat(apiBaseService.middleware),
  devTools: true,
});

const { dispatch } = store;
setupListeners(dispatch);

export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;

export { store, dispatch };
```

### Redux Toolkit Query

RTK Query simplifies data fetching and caching, reducing the amount of code needed to manage server state and handle async requests.

#### Queries and Mutations

- **Query**: Used to fetch data. It is defined by a query endpoint that describes how to fetch the data.
- **Mutation**: Used to modify data on the server. It is defined by a mutation endpoint specifying the server interaction.

**Example of a Service with Queries and Mutations:**

```typescript
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";

const apiBaseService = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: "http://localhost:8585" }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getUserData: builder.query<User, void>({
      query: () => "",
    }),
    updateUserData: builder.mutation<void, Partial<User>>({
      query: (userData) => ({
        url: "",
        method: "PUT",
        body: userData,
      }),
    }),
  }),
});

export const { useGetUserDataQuery, useUpdateUserDataMutation } = apiBaseService;
export default apiBaseService;
```

In this example, `getUserData` is a query endpoint for fetching user data, and `updateUserData` is a mutation endpoint for updating user information.

#### API Base Service

The **API Base Service** defines common configuration for all API endpoints, including headers, authentication, and response handling. This is achieved by creating an `apiBaseService` using `createApi` and specifying the base query and endpoints.

**Example of API Base Service:**

```typescript
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";

const baseQuery = fetchBaseQuery({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8585",
  prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
    const token = getState().global.auth.access_token;
    if (token) {
      headers.set("Authorization", `Bearer ${token}`);
    }
    headers.set("Content-Type", "application/json");
    return headers;
  },
});

export const apiBaseService = createApi({
  baseQuery,
  endpoints: (builder) => ({}),
});
```

### Custom Hooks

To facilitate type-safe access to the Redux store and dispatch actions, we create custom hooks using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.

**Example of Custom Hooks:**

```typescript
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from "./store";

export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

### Middleware and Listener Setup

Middleware in Redux Toolkit allows us to extend the capabilities of the Redux store. In this setup, the API service middleware is integrated, and `setupListeners` is used to enable features like automatic refetching of data.

**Middleware and Listener Setup:**

```typescript
import { setupListeners } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query";
import { apiBaseService } from "./services/apiBaseService";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    global: rootReducer,
    [apiBaseService.reducerPath]: apiBaseService.reducer,
  },
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(apiBaseService.middleware),
});

setupListeners(store.dispatch);
```

## Putting It All Together

The combination of React, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query forms a cohesive architecture for building scalable and efficient web applications. Here's how the pieces fit together:

1. **React Components** render the UI and interact with the Redux store to display and update state.
2. **Slices** define specific areas of the state, providing actions and reducers to manage data changes.
3. **Store Configuration** integrates slices and middleware, creating a centralized state management system.
4. **RTK Query** handles data fetching and caching, simplifying server interactions and state synchronization.
5. **Custom Hooks** offer type-safe access to the Redux store, ensuring consistency and reducing boilerplate.
6. **API Base Service** centralizes API configurations, enabling seamless integration of authentication and data handling.
   Certainly! Let's break down the structure of your React project, explaining how components, features, and views are organized. I'll also cover how libraries like `react-router-dom`, `react-bootstrap`, and `prime-react` fit into the project.

---

## Project Structure

Your React project is organized into directories that group components by functionality, making it easier to maintain and scale. Here's a detailed explanation of the folder structure:

### **1. `src`**

This is the main directory of your React application, containing all the source code needed for the app to run. Within `src`, you have the following subdirectories:

### **2. `assets`**

This folder is typically used to store static files, such as images, fonts, or any resources that need to be served directly without modification. For example, you can place logos or icons here.

### **3. `components`**

This directory contains reusable, general-purpose components that are not necessarily tied to a specific feature of the application. Here's what's included:

- **`components/CaOSButton`**: Likely contains a custom button component used in various parts of the application.

- **`components/CaOSInput`**: A custom input component for forms.

- **`components/CaOSSpinner`**: A spinner or loading indicator component used while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete.

### **4. `features`**

The `features` directory groups components and logic that belong to a specific functionality or module of your application. You have several subdirectories representing different features:

#### **Authentication**

- **`AuthForm`**: A component for user authentication forms. It handles both user login and registration.

- **`RequireAuth`**: A route protection component. It ensures that certain routes are accessible only to authenticated users.

- **`useAuthForm`**: A custom hook that manages logic related to authentication forms.

#### **PackageDistribution**

- **`PackageDistribution`**: Manages the distribution of packages in your application, likely related to sharing or distributing data.

- **`ShareRepoModal`**: A modal component for sharing a repository or package.

- **`usePackageDistribution`**: A hook that encapsulates logic related to package distribution.

- **`UserAccessList`**: A list showing users who have access to certain packages or resources.

#### **PackageRetrieval**

- **`PackageRetrieval`**: Manages the retrieval or downloading of packages, related to accessing and downloading resources.

#### **UI (User Interface)**

- **`authbar`**: An authentication bar component that might show login options or the user's status.

- **`menu`**: A component that handles menu navigation.

- **`Navbar`**: The main navigation bar of the application.

- **`ProfileBar`**: A profile bar component that might display user information or options related to user accounts.

#### **UserSettings**

- **`UserSettings`**: Manages user preferences and settings within the application.

### **5. `views`**

The `views` directory contains components that represent different pages or sections of your application. These are typically routed using `react-router-dom`:

- **`views/Home`**: The home page component, which is typically the main landing area after a user logs in.

- **`views/Landing`**: The landing page component, usually the first page users see when they visit your site.

- **`views/Profile`**: The profile page component where users can view and edit their personal information.

- **`views/Layout`**: A layout component that provides a consistent structure for wrapping different views.

---

## App Component

Here's a breakdown of your main `App` component and how it sets up routing and integrates with the libraries you're using:

```tsx
import "./App.css";
import { Home } from "./views/Home/Home";
import { Layout } from "./views/Layout";
import { Landing } from "./views/Landing/Landing";
import { Profile } from "./views/Profile/Profile";
import { AuthForm } from "./features/Authentication/AuthForm";
import { Container } from "react-bootstrap";
import { RequireAuth } from "./features/Authentication/RequireAuth";
import { ToastContainer } from "react-toastify";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import UserSettings from "./features/UserSettings/UserSettings";
import PackageRetrieval from "./features/PackageRetrieval/PackageRetrieval";
import PackageDistribution from "./features/PackageDistribution/PackageDistribution";

/**
 * The main component of the application.
 * Renders the application layout and sets up the routing.
 */
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Router>
        <Routes>
          {/* Public routes */}
          <Route path="/auth" element={<AuthForm />} />
          <Route path="/register" element={<AuthForm />} />
          <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
            <Route index element={<Landing />} />
            <Route element={<RequireAuth />}>
              <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
              <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
              <Route path="/packages-retrieval" element={<PackageRetrieval />} />
              <Route path="/packages-distribution" element={<PackageDistribution />} />
              <Route path="/user-settings" element={<UserSettings />} />
            </Route>
          </Route>
        </Routes>
      </Router>
      <ToastContainer />
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Explanation of the App Component:

1. **Imports**:

   - **CSS and Views**: Imports `App.css` for styles and various view components for rendering different pages.
   - **Features**: Imports authentication components and other feature-related components.
   - **Libraries**:
     - **`react-bootstrap`**: Used for styling and layout with Bootstrap components.
     - **`react-toastify`**: Used for displaying toast notifications.
     - **`react-router-dom`**: Provides routing capabilities to navigate between different views.

2. **Routing Setup**:

   - **`Router`**: Wraps the application with a `BrowserRouter` to enable routing.
   - **`Routes`**: Defines a set of routes for the application.
   - **Public Routes**: Includes routes like `/auth` and `/register` for authentication forms that are accessible to everyone.
   - **Protected Routes**:
     - Uses the `RequireAuth` component to wrap routes that require authentication, such as `/home`, `/profile`, `/packages-retrieval`, `/packages-distribution`, and `/user-settings`.
     - This ensures users must be logged in to access these routes.
   - **`Layout`**: Wraps the main routes to provide a consistent layout across different pages.

3. **Toast Notifications**:
   - **`ToastContainer`**: Added to display toast notifications using `react-toastify`.

### Libraries Used:

- **`react-router-dom`**: Handles routing and navigation in the application. It allows you to define public and protected routes easily.

- **`react-bootstrap`**: Provides Bootstrap components for styling and layout, ensuring a responsive design.

- **`prime-react`**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, `prime-react` offers a set of UI components and styles that can be used throughout the application for consistent design.
