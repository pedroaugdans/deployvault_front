--> Frontend bugs: URGENT:
- Keeping the Package Distribution list while swapping users!
- Infinite request bug when there are no packages available!

--> Format logged username top-right, not just a horrible black text

--> Move footer to be always at the bottom of the screen? Package list minimum height??

--> Make home bar appear and dissappear, add uiSlice (?) to make that setting and enable and disable 

--> Footer - style as Gui is proposing

--> CaOS content fix
